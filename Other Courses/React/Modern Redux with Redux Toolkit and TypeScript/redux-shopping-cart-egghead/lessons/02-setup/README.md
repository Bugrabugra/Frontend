## Setup and Explore our Shopping Cart Application to Learn Redux with TypeScript

This course builds off a react-based shopping cart application containing a list of products (loaded dynamically from a JSON file). It is fully self-sustaining and does not rely on any third party APIs. It uses [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the underlying bundler and development tool with [react-ts](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) preset.

To get started simply follow the these instructions:

```
git clone git@github.com:xjamundx/redux-shopping-cart.git
cd redux-shopping-cart
git checkout egghead
npm install
npm run dev
open http://localhost:3000
```

**Note** This course uses a shopping cart application to demonstrate redux principles. It is not meant to demonstrate anything about making actual financial transactions over the web.
