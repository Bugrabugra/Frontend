## Intro to Modern Redux with RTK and TypeScript

I have a few courses out now about using Redux Hooks, including [Redux with React Hooks](https://egghead.io/courses/redux-with-react-hooks-8a37) and [Modernizing a Legacy Redux Application with Redux Hooks](https://egghead.io/courses/modernizing-a-legacy-redux-application-with-react-hooks-c528), but redux hooks are only part of the story. They make it easy to connect your components with your redux store, but setting up and maintaining that store is still left up to you. [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) on the other hand provides some really nice guardrails and simplifies that process. It also includes utilities that improve TypeScript's ability to understand redux.

This course follows the process of bringing redux in to manage the data in a shopping cart application. It focuses on splitting your store into slices, creating reducers and selectors and managing async actions with thunks. Our shopping cart app will allow you to see a dynamic list of products, add items to a cart, and eventually checkout.

Follow along by creating this redux shopping cart application with me and then apply what you've learned to your own applications.

Thank you so much for watching!
