## Handling Custom Actions in our Slice with extraReducers and the Builder API

In our previous lessons we relied on actions generated by our `createSlice` function. In this lesson we build our own. Thankfully action objects are very simple. It's recommended that they follow the [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action#flux-standard-action) convention which typically looks something like this:

```ts
{
  type: "feature/action",
  payload: "some kind of data" // could be anything
}
```

In our case we dispatch the action `{ type: "cart/checkout/pending" }`.

To handle arbitrary actions in our slice, we use the `extraReducers` property and the [Builder API](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createreducer#usage-with-the-builder-callback-notation) which provides a way to define cases for the reducer to handle without using the `switch` statement, so commonly found in legacy redux applications.
